# Lean React boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate to launch React experiments fast.

It's based in an example of the book *React: Up & Running: Building Web Applications* by Stoyan Stefanov (c) (O'Reily ISBN-10: 1491931825 ISBN-13: 978-1491931820) but adding new libraries like Webpack instead of browserify.
